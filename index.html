<p></p><p>My name is Cristian Josan and during the period of one year (24/06/13 - 27/06/14) I have worked as a Business Intern within FFastFill and then ION Trading. I had the special chance of being present at FFastFill when the company physically merged with a larger group of firms, collectively known as the ION Trading Group. Due to this change, my role and the roles of many other employees have shifted several times. This was a rich experience, both in theory and practice, which offered me the opportunity to get a grasp of the various sides of the business.</p>
<p>As a result, during the placement, I have been involved in the activities of Human Resources, Office and Data Centre Administration, IT Support,&nbsp;Financial Accounting, &nbsp;and finally Procurement.</p><p></p>

            <p>I think that I should focus on the development of communication skills in order to ease the delivery of my ideas. At times, my style of speech may appear confusing and I need to practice being concise and straight to the point.</p>
<p>To improve this area, I decided to watch business conversations' recordings and also invest in a book, which teaches Communication for Business. I believe that if I increase my ability to establish clearer conversations then it would help me build a professional image of myself.This in turn should be of assistance during formal meetings, discussions with customers, but also aid me at the job interviews that are to going to come after the final year.</p>

This report in particular reflects the kind of work that I produced in Excel for FFastFill. It usually involved rigorous analysis of data and usage of formula-heavy expressions in order to reach the desired outcome. This report specifically has the purpose of calculating the annual overtime cost for FFastFill by analysing the additional hours that were worked by the employees from the Operations Department. The analysis has been created to cover over 30,000 individual records of the global staff during the year of 2013. </div>

    <div class="detail">This Master Schedule analysis reflects a thorough record of the contractual agreements made between FFastFill and a 'Confidential' customer. It serves the purpose of storing the historic revenue on a customer's basis and also predict the expected payments from that customer. The creation of Master Schedules was one of the most important projects of the Finance team at the time of the merge with ION Trading. </div>

            <p>My placement enabled me to try various areas of the business. Thanks to this, it was possible for me to decide on my future career aspirations.</p>
<p>It seems that after working during the year within the Finance department, specialising specifically in the management of payable accounts, I developed a liking for Finance. I believe that this is the specialisation that I enjoy the most and at which I have a proven record of high performance and efficiency. As a result, at the beginning of this year, I chose Finance as the pathway for my 4th year at Bournemouth University.</p>
<p>Going forward, I plan to graduate with at least a 2:1 and seek employment straight-away. I was informed by ION's representatives that I'm always welcome to inquire about any open positions at their company. As I was satisfied with my placement and I noticed that the working environment is pleasant, I would definitely contact them. Apart from this option, I will be keen to apply to any other openings, which I will deem as relevant to my aspirations of specialising in Finance and Accounting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, in the near future, I look forward to studying towards the CIMA Management Accountanting&nbsp;qualification. It&nbsp;is one of the most advanced learning and professional development programmes available and it will help me improve my prospects in this area.</p>

            <p><strong>Main Achievements during the Placement year:</strong></p>
<ol><li><span style="line-height:1.333em;">At the middle of September I have noticed that FFastFill was receiving too many statements and legal notices for the overdue accounts within Accounts Payable. In view of this, I speculated that the problem occurred, because the financial accountants had too many tasks to take care of. As a result, I communicated with our Chief Financial Officer who appreciated my willingness to help and suggested to get in touch with the Financial Department, which is based in the Czech Republic. After I received his approval, I contacted Libor Hrozinek (Credit Controller) and proposed covering the processing of invoices on Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Great Plains (GP) software for the entity of FFastFill Europe. &nbsp;An agreement was reached swiftly on this and since then I have learned about the company’s existing leased lines, exchange services, financial codes and have kept their accounting records updated. The result is that nowadays there are considerably less reminders and statements arriving for us. The number of chasing phone calls has dropped as well, which has saved the time of the Finance department.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height:1.333em;background-color:#ffff99;">Since I started assisting with this, on the 24th of September, more than 500 invoices were registered on the system and I ensured that they are ready to be processed during their respective payment runs. This represents a quantity of 60%+ of the supplier invoices that were being addressed to FFastFill.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height:1.333em;background-color:#ffff99;"><span style="line-height:1.333em;background-color:#ffffff;">I worked closely with the Procurement Department at ION Trading in order to produce and maintain a database for our Purchase Orders raised on the Aestiva Purchase Order software. The need for it stemed from the fact that the software was limited and significantly slow in its display of overall data. This enabled us to better organise the quotes in order to facilitate the searching process. After creating the database and a template for it, I have demonstrated the advantages of its use to a number of employees in the company. At present, this has grown to be the most comprehensive database of our services and products and I've been providing updated versions of it to our Procurement Managers and Credit Controllers ever since.</span><br></span></li>
<li><span style="line-height:1.333em;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="line-height:1.333em;background-color:#ffffff;">As a part of the process of the merge between FFastFill and ION Trading, I, along with a couple of other employees from the Finance department, had the responsibility of creating a reconciliation of Master Schedules for the revenue from our customers.&nbsp;A Master Schedule serves as a financial analysis of ACV (annual contracted value) originating in contracts with our clients on per item basis. I finished my part of the project ahead of the deadline and helped other employees with the calculation of the revenue.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="line-height:1.333em;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="line-height:1.333em;background-color:#ffffff;">At ION Trading I focused equally on Finance as well as Procurement. As mentioned earlier, one of my main responsibilities derived from liasing and helping the managers from the Procurement department. One of the most significant achievements has been obtained while creating a cost comparison for a conferencing contract. Our company had to renew the contract for the internet conferencing services and could choose between three providers. I prepared a cost comparison where the proposed rates and the previous year's cumulative expenses were used in order to calculate the average expenditures, which we might expect during the following years. The Procurement manager and the Chief Information Officer whom I presented this analysis were pleased by the explanation and offered me to take part in the negotiation process, because I was most familiar with our historic spending. Thus, I have attended WebEx negotiations with these providers for several months. In the end, we, the negotiation team managed to lower the prospective cost of the contract by ~£10,000 per month.</span></span></li>

            <p>My Employer Feedback was written by Fabio Nani, who is the global Procurement Manager for Service/Product Purchases and Company Acquisitions at ION Trading.</p>
<p>Since FFastFill has merged with ION, I have been mostly working together with Fabio and thus he is the person who is most suitable for offering the feedback. The points that he stressed in the manager’s report revolved around two ideas. On one hand, Fabio considers me to be an intern who was fully prepared in order to meet the requirements of the role. On the other hand, he thinks that I should not be afraid of coming out of my comfort zone to express my views more often on matters.</p>
<p>During the appraisal it was highlighted that the quality of my output was at a high level and that the procurement team appreciated my contribution to the department. However it was suggested to me that an area that I could develop is represented by social skills. Particularly, it would be beneficial to improve my communication and make myself heard more.</p>
<p>Whilst I agree with this statement, I have to note that occasionally I had the tendency to restrain myself from making comments. Maybe this was not the best approach to take, but in my position as a placement student, I found it important not to argue more than needed in order to successfully reach my goals. &nbsp;</p>
